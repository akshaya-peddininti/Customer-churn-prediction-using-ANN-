Overview:
This repository contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model built to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. The model aims to identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services, allowing for targeted retention strategies.

Dataset:
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
Description: The dataset includes various customer attributes, such as demographics, account information, and service usage, to help predict churn.

Model Architecture:
The model is built using Keras and consists of:

Input Layer: 26 neurons (features).
Hidden Layers:
First hidden layer with 26 neurons and ReLU activation.
Second hidden layer with 15 neurons and ReLU activation.
Output Layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation, outputting the probability of churn.

Results
Model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) will be provided based on the evaluation.
Visualizations of training history (loss and accuracy over epochs) can also be included.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of an ANN model to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The insights gained can help businesses implement effective customer retention strategies.
